# Controlling WAYA supply

## Does WAYA have a hard cap?

Yes, WAYA now has a hard cap of 750M as outlined in our litepaper [https://v2litepaper.PlexSwap.finance/](https://v2litepaper.PlexSwap.finance/)

## How WAYA supply is reduced

The chefs aim to **make deflation higher than emission** by building deflationary mechanisms into PlexSwap's products. The goal is for more WAYA to leave circulation than the amount of WAYA that's produced.

### Reducing block emissions

By reducing the amount of WAYA made per block, we slow inflation. This has already been done once: Since the [first reduction in block emissions](https://voting.PlexSwap.finance/#/plexswap/proposal/QmWSQZsqakCMQ1bmcoEsKzStdtdFHL6cohSjnMV9ira1EC), we've already effectively reduced the number of WAYA entering circulation from 40 WAYA per block to 13.75. But we don't want to do this too frequently, too early, we want to still incentivize people to provide liquidity.

### Deflationary mechanisms

Regular token burns ([view burn address](https://bscscan.com/token/0x0e09fabb73bd3ade0a17ecc321fd13a19e81ce82?a=0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dead)) are built into many of PlexSwap's products (like a 10% burn of WAYA spent on lottery tickets), with more on the way. Check the [**WAYA Tokenomics page**](https://docs.PlexSwap.finance/tokenomics/waya/waya-tokenomics) for details on present and upcoming deflationary mechanisms.
