# What Is the Private key, Mnemonic and Wallet Password ?

**Private key**\
****When dealing with cryptocurrency, a user is usually given a public address and a private key to send and receive coins or tokens. The public address is where the funds are deposited and received. But even though a user has tokens deposited into their address, they wonâ€™t be able to withdraw them without the unique private key.

The private key can take a few different forms, usually depicted as a series of alphanumeric characters, which makes it hard for a hacker to crack. Most users represent their wallet keys in wallet import format, which has 51 characters. Think of a public address as a mailbox, and the private key as the key to the box.

On any wallet, by importing the private key and setting a new password you can import the assets from the previous A wallet into the B wallet. For example, if a mobile phone is lost, the assets can be recovered by simply importing the private key.

**Mnemonic**	\
Because the private key is composed of 64-bit hexadecimal, which is inconvenient to record and copy. For users' convenience, mnemonic was generated. It is simplified into a mnemonic consisting of 12 words, with a space between each word. The mnemonic and private key have the same function, that is, you can import the wallet by entering the mnemonic and setting a new password. Like the private key, a wallet has one set of mnemonics and cannot be modified.

Anybody else who discovers the phrase can steal the cryptos, so it must be kept safe like jewels or cash. For example, no one should ask you for it on social networks or messenger, it must not be typed into any website.



**Wallet Password**\
****When creating a wallet you need to set a password of at least 8 characters. The wallet password is used to manage the wallet, e.g. to transfer funds, and must be entered when importing a wallet with a private key/keyword. Passwords can be changed or reset. If the original password is forgotten, the wallet can be imported with the private key or mnemonic words and a new password can be set.

An analogy can be drawn with bank accounts to differentiate between them.\
Private key = bank card number + bank card password\
Mnemonic = bank card number + card password\
Password = bank card password
