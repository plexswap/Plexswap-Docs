# Phishing App Scam

The scammer will develop Apps that are highly similar to the official App. When the user creates or imports a wallet, the data will be recorded and synchronized to the scammerâ€™s specific server. As a result, users have a great risk of being stolen by scammers.

Therefore, users must download and use the wallet through official channels.&#x20;
