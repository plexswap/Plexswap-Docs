# Phishing Website Scam

"Phishing website" refers to a fake website used to deceive users. Its page is basically the same as the real website. Scammers use fake sites to deceive and steal users' private keys or mnemonics. In general, Phishing websites have only one or a few pages, which are slightly different from real websites. They usually spread fake giveaways/airdrops, or impersonate official supports, or other means on communities to attract users to use their fake websites.&#x20;
