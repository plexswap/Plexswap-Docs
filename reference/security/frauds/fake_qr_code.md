# Fake QR Code Scam

Fake QR code scam refers to that fraudsters use fake QR codes to let users perform operations such as approval. Usually, the user will enter the transfer interface or phishing pages after scanning the code. Actually, this transfer operation is an approval process. If the user clicks "Approve", the fraudster will obtain permission to transfer the asset, which leads to the loss of the asset.&#x20;

In addition, some posters of fake airdrop activities will also have a fake QR code attached. Airdrop tokens are used to attract users to scan the code. After scanning, "Approve" operations are required to receive the airdrop, which will fall into the trap of scammers and your tokens will be maliciously transferred.
