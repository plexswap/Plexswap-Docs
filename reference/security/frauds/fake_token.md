# Fake Token Scam

Scammers counterfeit tokens by using similar token names and symbols, and then they will exchange for real tokens that are well-known tokens. The main victims are mostly new users since users who get familiar with the blockchain can judge a token by checking the contract address of the token, such as the common USDT, ETH, BTC, etc.&#x20;

The scammers will sell their fake tokens at a very attractive price to those who are long to buy. Actually, these tokens cannot be traded and have no value.&#x20;

Therefore, it is necessary to **check the token contract and other information** according to the official token information before making a transfer and do not trust a third party easily!
