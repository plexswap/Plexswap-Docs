# Loss Prevention

First of all, asset loss does not mean that the asset is lost in the blockchain but the loss of control of the asset, that is, the security information of the wallet is not safe. During the wallet creation process, the mnemonic or private key will be provided for the user to save, which will make it second-verified. After verifying, users can start to use the wallet.

Therefore, it is important to back up the wallet and keep it properly. Here, we recommend the use of physical/offline storage, which can be stored in multiple channels (must be safe channels), and do not lose or disclose your security information. In this way, even if there is an abnormal situation in your wallet, you can continue to use another wallet by importing the private key or mnemonic phrase.
