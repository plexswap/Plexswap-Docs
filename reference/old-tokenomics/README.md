* Stake it in [Syrup Pools](../../products/syrup-pool/) to earn free tokens
* Use it in [Yield Farms](https://docs.PlexSwap.finance/products/yield-farming) to earn more CAKE
* Buy Lottery tickets in the [PlexSwap Lottery](../../products/lottery/)
* Participate in [IFO Token Sales](../../products/ifo-initial-farm-offering/)
* Create your [Pancake Profile](../../products/nft-profile-system/) and mint NFTs
