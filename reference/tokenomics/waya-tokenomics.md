## **Emission rate** <a href="#emission-rate" id="emission-rate"></a>

### **Per block**

| **Metric**                                                                   | **Emission/block (WAYA)** | **Emission/day (WAYA)** |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------: | ----------------------: |
| Emission                                                                     |                        40 |               1,152,000 |
| Burned Weekly [(PID 138)](waya-tokenomics-v1.md#why-is-the-waya-burn-manual) |                    -25.75 |                -787,600 |
| **Effective Emission**                                                       |              **<14.25\*** |           **364,400\*** |

\*Effective Emission is in fact slightly below this amount: an additional 45,000 WAYA per day is diverted from the amount allocated to the lottery, and burned (PID 137 - Details below).

In addition to the above, a dynamic amount of WAYA is also [minted to the Dev address](https://bscscan.com/address/0xceba60280fb0ecd9a5a26a1552b90944770a4a0e#tokentxns) at a rate of 9.09%. This means that if 100 WAYA are harvested, then 9.09 WAYA is minted in addition and sent to the Dev Address.

{% hint style="info" %}
All WAYA minted to the Dev address is burned in the weekly burn and never enters circulation.&#x20;

As such, we haven't included it in the above emission rate.
{% endhint %}

## Distribution <a href="#distribution" id="distribution"></a>

| Distributed to                | Reward/block (% of emission) | Reward/block (total WAYA) |           Reward/day |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------: | ------------------------: | -------------------: |
| Farms              |                       10.62% |                      4.25 |     122,400 (approx) |
| of which diverted and burned  |                              |                           |              -46,000 |
| Gaya Pools                   |                          25% |                        10 |     288,000 (approx) |
| **Total Daily WAYA Emission** |                              |                           | **364,400 (approx)** |

## **Other Deflationary Mechanics** <a href="#other-deflationary-mechanics" id="other-deflationary-mechanics"></a>

{% hint style="info" %}
The burning process is currently manual. [View burn transactions here](https://bscscan.com/token/0x0e09fabb73bd3ade0a17ecc321fd13a19e81ce82?a=0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dead).
{% endhint %}

As well as the above, WAYA is also burned in the following ways:

* **0.05%** of every trade made on PlexSwap V2
* **100%** of WAYA sent to the Dev address
* **100%** of WAYA bid during Farm Auctions
* **20%** of WAYA spent on lottery tickets
* **45,000** WAYA per day (historically assigned to the lottery) (_The WAYA for this is generated by a farm - PID 137)_
* **2%** of every yield harvest in the Auto WAYA Pool

## Why is the WAYA burn manual?

To hit the ground running, PlexSwap launched as an MVP (minimum viable product) with the TaskMaster contract emitting 40 WAYA per block. For that reason, the early team didn't add additional functions such as the ability to customize the WAYA minting logic. As migrating to a new TaskMaster would require a lot of time and effort, the team opted to reduce WAYA emissions instead through a manual burn process by creating the following pool:

* Burn Pool (PID - 138) - burned WAYA per block

These pools work similarly to the farms, where the Farmers can adjust the percentage of the 40 WAYA per block allocated to it after each WAYA emission reduction vote.

{% hint style="warning" %}
On the day of the burn, the supply shown on the homepage might suddenly jump by several million WAYA.&#x20;

Don't worry - **THIS WAYA NEVER ACTUALLY ENTERS CIRCULATION:**
{% endhint %}

This apparent jump is just because of how all the WAYA that's allocated for the burn is stored during the week.&#x20;

The WAYA sent to both pools PID-137 and PID-138 are harvested before completing the weekly token burns, and this makes the Total Supply shown on the site jumping by \~6M. This is because pending WAYA isnâ€™t registered in the Total Supply until it's harvested on the burn day. Once the token burn transaction is completed, the \~6M is shown in the Burned to Date.&#x20;

## How to Confirm WAYA Supply for yourself

To confirm that the circulating WAYA supply shown on the PlexSwap homepage is correct,&#x20;

1. Head to the WAYA token contract on BscScan and [see how much WAYA is held by the Burn Address.](https://bscscan.com/token/0x0e09fabb73bd3ade0a17ecc321fd13a19e81ce82#balances) That's the total amount of WAYA that's been burned (removed from circulation FOREVER, and impossible to ever retrieve).
2. Then, subtract this burned amount from the "Total Supply" that BscScan shows.
3. This gives you the actual WAYA supply.
