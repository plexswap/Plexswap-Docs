# Controlling WAYA Supply

## Does WAYA have a hard cap?

Yes, WAYA has a hard cap of 750M.

## How WAYA supply is reduced

The farmers aim to **make deflation higher than emission** by building deflationary mechanisms into PlexSwap's products. The goal is for more WAYA to leave circulation than the amount of WAYA that's produced.

### Deflationary mechanisms

Regular token burns ([view burn address](https://bscscan.com/token/0x0e09fabb73bd3ade0a17ecc321fd13a19e81ce82?a=0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dead)) are built into many of PlexSwap's products, with more on the way. Check the [**WAYA Tokenomics page**](https://docs.plexfinance.us/tokenomics/waya/waya-tokenomics) for details on present and upcoming deflationary mechanisms.
