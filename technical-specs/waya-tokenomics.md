## How to Confirm WAYA Supply for yourself

To confirm that the circulating WAYA supply shown on the PlexSwap homepage is correct,

1. Head to the WAYA token contract on BscScan and [see how much WAYA is held by the Burn Address.](https://bscscan.com/token/0x32d9F70F6eF86718A51021ad269522Abf4CFFE49#balances) That's the total amount of WAYA that's been burned (removed from circulation FOREVER, and impossible to ever retrieve).
2. Then, subtract this burned amount from the "Total Supply" that BscScan shows.
3. This gives you the actual WAYA supply.
