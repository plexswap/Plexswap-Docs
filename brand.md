# Brand & Logos

![](.gitbook/assets/Brand\_Logo-Guidelines.png)

## Intro

As everyone has already noticed, Symplexia's strategy was to try to make the most of all the creation effort already applied to the world of exchanges (mainly Uniswap & PancakeSwap). We try to get away from the temptation to reinvent the wheel, although we think that any attempt in this direction is perfectly possible and plausible. So, everything from PlexSwap is naturally and natively from the Community, so feel free to use in the way you want. The world is yours, the future is ours.

> However, be careful to preserve our brands rights.

The following PlexSwap "Brand Assets" are copyrighted material, and you may only use them in accordance with the policy detailed below:

* The PlexSwap and WAYA logos, wordmark, icon
* The PlexSwap name
* Other visual assets produced by PlexSwap including but not limited to illustrations and 3d models

## What you may do

You may use PlexSwap's Brand Assets when you are:

* üëå Referring to our products and services
* üëå Linking to our official site or products, such as "Trade our token on PlexSwap"
* üëå Announcing an official partnership, but only if you have **official approval** by a qualified member of the PlexSwap team

For information on other uses of our Brand Assets, please reach out at development@symplexia.com

## What you may not do

While we strongly believe in and follow the open source ethos, **protecting the PlexSwap brand is extremely important for our users' security,** so that users know what is a genuine product/endorsement and what isn't.

Here are a few examples of forbidden uses of our Brand Assets:

* ‚õîÔ∏è **Don't use our Brand Assets in your products' name, logo, NFTs, etc.**
  * For example, making an app called "PlexSwap Engine" or "WAYA Child" are not allowed.
  * Don't use the PlexSwap logo in whole or in part as part of your products' logos, marketing material, website, or other.
  * Logos with a strong resemblence to the PlexSwap Icon are also forbidden.
* ‚õîÔ∏è **Don't use our Brand Assets to create digital or physcial products for sale, including but not limited to**
  * Merchandise ("Swag")
  * NFTs
  * Other products
*   ‚õîÔ∏è **Don't create derivative names that imply official endorsement**

    For example, don't make a social media group called "PlexSwap Italy" - this sounds official. "PlexSwap Fans of Italy" may be permitted.
*   ‚õîÔ∏è **Don't change or adapt our Brand Assets in any way**

    Use the logos and other assets exactly as provided. Do not change the colors, reassemble, abbreviate, or change these assets in any way.

Use your common sense and creativity. If you want to make something relating to the PlexSwap ecosystem, make it your own.

Have fun making a unique brand that's clearly yours -- if your product is strong, you won't need to rely on remixing PlexSwap's brand.
