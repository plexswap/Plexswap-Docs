Voting gives a voice to the PlexSwap community, letting the community have a say in how PlexSwap develops into the future.

Check out [PlexSwap's native voting portal](https://voting.plexswap.finance/?\_gl=1\*pc8o0h\*\_ga\*MTUzNDEzNDQxMy4xNjAwNzkzNDM4\*\_ga\_334KNG3DMQ\*MTYwNDMwMTk4Ni42MC4xLjE2MDQzMDM3MDIuMA..#/) on the PlexSwap website.

**Core** - proposals posted by the PlexSwap team. The results will be actioned.

**Community** - proposals posted by the PlexSwap community. These are used to propose ideas and show the communities point of view. The PlexSwap team reviews every community vote and will often move any with strong community support up to the CORE proposal level.
