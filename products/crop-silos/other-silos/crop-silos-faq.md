# Crop Silos FAQ & Troubleshooting

## Troubleshooting

### **I can't find the Crop Silo I was staking in!**

You should be able to find the Crop Silo under the “Finished” tab on the Crop Silos page.&#x20;

By selecting “Staked Only”, it will make it easier to find your assets.

### **Why can’t I unstake my tokens from a Crop Silo?**

If you are unable to unstake from the WAYA Silos, please check to make sure that you haven’t sold the GAYA tokens in your wallet. This token acts as a \`proof of ownership\` over your WAYA in the Manual WAYA Silo.&#x20;

### **Why did my earned tokens go to zero after staking/unstaking?**

Don’t worry! They’re in your wallet already.

Whenever you stake or unstake from a Crop Silo or farm, your earned tokens get harvested and sent to your wallet at the same time.

## **General Questions**

### How is APR for Crop Silos calculated?

> Crop Silo APR = Annualized rewards (USD) / User funds staked in Crop Silo (USD) \* 100

As a basic example, let's take a 60-day pool with 300,000 USD worth of rewards, and 3,000,000 USD worth of WAYA staked in it.

The APR fluctuates as more WAYA is staked by users, and as the price of WAYA, and the reward token, vary.

| ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Total rewards to distribute (USD value)               |                                   | 300,000 USD                                |
| Distribution period                                   |                                   | 60 days                                    |
| Daily distribution                                    | 300,000 / 60 =                    | 5,000 USD daily                            |
| **Annualised rewards (USD value)**                    | 5,000 \* 365 =                    | **1,825,000 USD**                          |
| **Value of WAYA staked by users in pool (USD value)** |                                   | **3,000,000 USD**                          |
| **APR**                                               | (1,825,000 / 3,000,000) \* 100 =  | <p></p><p><strong>60.833% APR</strong></p> |

### **What does the “End” number on my Crop Silo refer to?**

This shows the amount of blocks left until the rewards for that pool stop being distributed. Once the pool has reached that block, you should unstake your tokens, because you won’t be receiving any rewards after that.

### **Where do the rewards from Crop Silos come from?**

There are three main types of Crop Silos.

1. Stake WAYA, earn WAYA
2. Stake WAYA, earn other tokens.&#x20;
3. Stake other tokens, earn WAYA

The rewards for the "Stake WAYA, earn WAYA" Crop Silos come from the [WAYA emissions](https://docs.plexswap.finance/tokenomics/waya/waya-tokenomics). Each block, a number of WAYA tokens are allocated as rewards for these pools.

The rewards for the "Stake WAYA, earn other tokens" type are provided by the project teams who sponsor a Crop Silo.

For the "Stake other tokens, earn WAYA" type, the PlexSwap treasury buys back WAYA from the market to distribute as rewards. These pools are funded by PlexSwap, not by the projects themselves.

### What’s GAYA Token?

PlexSwap’s GAYA Token is deposited in your wallet when you interact with the **Manual** “Stake WAYA, Earn WAYA” Crop Silo. It's not staked for&#x20;

It’s basically an IOU that shows how much WAYA you’ve staked in the pool.

It’ll be returned automatically when you unstake your WAYA from that pool.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Don’t sell your GAYA tokens! You need to return your GAYA to unstake your WAYA from the Manual WAYA Silo. The amount of GAYA you return must be the same as the amount of WAYA you unstake.
{% endhint %}
