# Other Crop Silos

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/how-to-GAYA-pool-staking-header.png)

Staking in [Crop Silos](https://docs.plexswap.finance/products/GAYA-pool) lets you earn WAYA or other tokens while you sleep!

It's simpler than farming with PlexSwap's Yield Farms because unlike the Farms, you only need to stake **one token** to start earning: usually WAYA.

## **Getting started with Crop Silo staking**

1\. Go to the Silos page [here](https://plexswap.finance/pools).

2\. Connect to your BNB Smart Chain-compatible wallet by clicking the **Connect** button (top right-hand side).

3\. Choose your wallet and connect.

4\. Choose which Crop Silo you want to stake in.

**Auto WAYA** automatically compounds your rewards: any WAYA you earn will be harvested and re-invested in the same pool for you.

**Manual WAYA** doesn’t automatically compound like Auto WAYA. You’ll need to harvest and compound your earnings manually.

Other Crop Silos let you stake your WAYA to earn dozens of other cool tokens. Make sure you check them out.

5\. Once you choose a Silo, click the **Enable** button. Your wallet will ask you to confirm the action.

6\. The Enable button should now be replaced with **Stake**. Click the button to bring up the staking menu.

9\. The Confirm button will change to "Confirming", then once the transaction is successful, you’ll see your staked amount change and the button will change again.

10\. You should now be able to see details on your Crop Silo. Auto WAYA will show a countdown until the unstaking fee ends. The other Silos will show a **Collect** button to claim your staking rewards into your wallet.

### **Adding and removing WAYA from a pool**

You can easily add more WAYA to a Crop Silo, or move some WAYA to a more profitable Silo. Here’s how you can move your staked WAYA.

1\. Click the **-** to take some WAYA out of a Silo, or the **+** to add more to the Silo.

Please note that unstaking from the Auto WAYA Silo has a fee of 0.1% if you unstake within 72 hours.

2\. A window will open. If you clicked the **+**, choose the amount you would like to add to the Silo. If you clicked the **-**, choose the amount to take out of the Silo.

3\. Click **Confirm**.

4\. After a little wait, you'll be able to see your new amount of staked tokens.
