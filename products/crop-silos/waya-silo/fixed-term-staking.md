# How to use the Fixed-Term Staking option

1\. Go to the Silos page [here](https://swap.plexinance.us/silos).

2\. Connect to your BNB Smart Chain-compatible wallet by clicking the **Connect** button (top right-hand side).

4\. Choose the Waya Silo and click the **Enable** button. Your wallet will ask you to confirm the action.

5\. The **Enable** button should now be replaced with **Flexible** and **Locked**. Click the button to bring up the staking menu.

6\. For Fixed-Term Staking simply press **Locked**, which will present you with a new window, enter the amount of WAYA you wish to stake and for how long you want to lock your WAYA for.

Below that, you will find a summary of your position, including APY, lock duration, and unlock date and time. Double-check to make sure you are okay with the lock duration and amount staked, click **Confirm** and confirm the transaction in your wallet.

Please note that we are still refining our UI including more precise unlock durations and a possible countdown.

## Extending your lock staking duration

Changed your mind during the lock staking duration? No problem. You can always extend the time of your locked WAYA by simply clicking "Extend" and choose how much time you want to add on top of the **initial lock duration**. Remember, the longer you lock, the higher your yield will be boosted. The maximum locking duration is 52 weeks.

A user's new extended lock duration = initial lock duration + added duration

**Example:**

A user staked 1,438.45 WAYA in fixed-term staking with an initial lock duration of 10 weeks on 7th May 2022.

On 18th June 2022 (6 weeks later, 4 weeks until the user's WAYA unlocks), the user decides they want to add 5 weeks to their lock duration.

1\. Navigate to the Waya Silo and click **Extend**.&#x20;

2\. Select the duration you would like to add (5 weeks in this example).\
\
Note that your new lock duration will equal your initial lock duration of 10 weeks plus the added 5 weeks for a new lock duration of 15 weeks.

3\. Double-check to make sure you are okay with the new extended lock duration and click **Confirm**.

Please note that you can not shorten the locking period nor withdraw your WAYA prematurely.

## Adding more WAYA to your lock

You can easily do that by renewing your fixed-term staking position. Simply click "Add WAYA" and choose how much WAYA you want to deposit.

Please note that adding more WAYA to an existing lock resets your staking term based on the remaining lock duration, essentially “renewing” your fixed-term staking position. This results in a lower yield boost because your new lock duration is lower than your initial lock duration.

**Example:**

A user staked 1,438.45 WAYA in fixed-term staking with an initial lock duration of 10 weeks on 7th May 2022.\
\
On 18th June 2022 (6 weeks later, 4 weeks until the user's WAYA unlocks), the user decides they want to add 100 WAYA to locked balance.

1\. Navigate to the Waya Silo and click **Add WAYA**.&#x20;

![Note that actual APY values will vary](../../../.gitbook/assets/6-how-to-stake-in-fixed-pool.png)

2\. Select the amount of WAYA you would like to add to your locked balance (for this example, we are adding 100 WAYA which is our max wallet balance). Note that your yield boost is lower than the initial yield boost because it is calculated using a 4 week lock duration instead of the initial 10 week lock duration.

2.1. Alternatively, users can check the box next to "Renew and extend your lock to keep similar benefits." to maintain a similar yield boost setting the lock duration equal to the initial lock duration (in this example, 10 weeks).

3\. Double-check to make sure you are okay with the added WAYA amount and the lock duration and click **Confirm**.
