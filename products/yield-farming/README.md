Yield Farms allow users to earn WAYA while supporting PlexSwap by staking LP Tokens.

Check out our [How to Use Farms](https://docs.plexfinance.us/products/yield-farming/how-to-use-farms) guide to get started with farming.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Yield farming can give better rewards than Crop Silos, but it comes with a risk of **Impermanent Loss**. Itâ€™s not as scary as it sounds, but it is worth learning about the concept before you get started.

Yield Farm APR calculations include both:

* **LP rewards APR** earned through providing liquidity and;
* **Farm base rewards APR** earned staking LP Tokens in the Farm.

So how do we calculate those figures?

### Calculating Farm Base Reward APR

The **Farm Base APR** is calculated according to the farm multiplier and the total amount of liquidity in the farm -- this is the amount of WAYA distributed to the farm.

### Calculating LP Reward APR

On top of that, farmers receive **LP rewards** for providing liquidity.&#x20;
