# ℹ PlexSwap Intro

![Where the Crops Begin](.gitbook/assets/Where\_the\_Crops\_Begin-II.png)

{% hint style="success" %}
**PlexSwap helps you make the most out of your crypto in three ways:**

**Trade, Earn, and Win.**
{% endhint %}

## ↔️ Trade

> Instantly swap crypto tokens: no registration or account needed.

### Low fees

Why pay more? PlexSwap runs on BNB Smart Chain, a blockchain with much lower transaction costs than Ethereum or Bitcoin.\
Trading fees are lower than other top decentralized exchanges too, so that's a double win for you!

### Decentralized

Trade directly from your wallet app.\
Unlike centralized exchanges like Binance or Coinbase, PlexSwap doesn’t hold your funds when you trade: **you have 100% ownership of your own crypto**.

## 💸 Earn

> Earn WAYA and other tokens for free with super high interest rates.

### Earn tokens with Crop Silos

Stake WAYA, earn free tokens. It’s really that easy.

### Earn WAYA with Yield Farms

Stake LP tokens, earn WAYA. You take on a little more exposure to market fluctuations than with the Crop Silos, but can earn higher APR to offset the risk.

### Earn Trading Fees

No farm? No problem. Even if your trading pair isn’t supported on the Farms page, you can still earn trading fees when you stake your tokens in Liquidity Pools (LPs).
